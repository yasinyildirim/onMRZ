This is a library that parses a machine readable zone (MRZ) found in Machine readable Documents for instance (Passport).
It parses PassportNumber, FirstName, LastName, dates (ex.date of birth, expire date), nationality and issuing country.
Currently, TD1 and TD3 types of MRZ format are supported.
It can also generate the MRZ string itslef (Machine Readable Zone) if all the proper parameters are passed to it.
